# Corona Hackathon 2020 App Concept: Let Us Walk

Registered, tracked, legal walks in times of corona lockdown.

App with government monitoring.

## Problem

More countries decide to lock-down the entire population in a domestic quarantine and the periods are constantly being extended. In China, the quarantine period in some areas is already over 40 days.
 
We need long-term concepts to cope with quarantine to ensure a follow-up to the quarantine and to support the health of each individual. In Italy, Spain as well as France the number of infringements is increasing.  

The health pressure of the quarantined population is increasing, especially in large cities where the living space and thus the space for movement is much smaller than in the countryside.

## Solution

One walk per capita per day, tracked and traceable for authorities. The route is organised, registered and tracked via the app. 


## Possible Issues which have to be considered

|  Issue | Solution  | Comment  |  
|---|---|---|
|  Mixing of shoppers and walkers | App should avoid supermarkets/famacies etc.  | Countries under lock-down show that people use shopping as a possibility to get out, so maybe even safer to do that with the app in an organized way  |
|  Elderly people have problems with using the smartphone |  Accompanying persons if available |   |
|  Children | Only with company of one person  |   |

# health-walk

**Corona Hackathon 2020 App Concept**

Registered, tracked, legal walks in times of corona lockdown
App with government monitoring.

## Concept

One walk per capita per day, tracked and traceable for authorities and police. The route is registered and organized via the app. Registered, tracked, legal walks in times of the corona lock-down. In Italy, Spain as well as France the number of infringements is increasing in times of national quarantine. In addition, the health pressure of the quarantined population is increasing, especially in large cities where the living space and thus the space for movement is much smaller than in the countryside.

## Possible Problems and Solutions

|  Problem | Solution  | Comment  |  
|---|---|---|
|  Mixing of shoppers and walkers | App should avoid supermarkets/famacies etc.  | Countries under lock-down show that people use shopping as a possibility to get out, so maybe even safer to do that with the app in an organized way  |
|  Elderly people have problems with using the smartphone |  Accompanying persons if available |   |
|  Children | Only with company of one person  |   |
